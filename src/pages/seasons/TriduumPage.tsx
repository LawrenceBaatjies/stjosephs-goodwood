                <p>
                  The Easter Triduum, often called the Sacred Triduum or simply the Triduum, is the period of three days that begins with the liturgy on the evening of Holy Thursday and reaches its culmination in the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday night. It marks the end of Lent and is the most solemn and important time in the liturgical year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During these three days, the Church commemorates the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus Christâ€”the events which are at the heart of our salvation. The word "triduum" comes from Latin meaning "three days." These days are counted using the Jewish understanding of sundown as the beginning of the day, so the Triduum consists of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Holy Thursday evening (Mass of the Lord's Supper)</li>
                  <li>Good Friday (Celebration of the Lord's Passion)</li>
                  <li>Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday (Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday Masses)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The Triduum is considered one unified liturgical celebration that unfolds over three days, inviting us to enter deeply into the mystery of our redemption.

                    <p>
                      The Triduum begins with the evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, which commemorates Jesus' institution of the Eucharist and the priesthood at the Last Supper. Key elements of this liturgy include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>The Washing of Feet</strong> - A ritual that recalls Jesus' washing of his disciples' feet, symbolizing his command to serve one another.</li>
                      <li><strong>The Transfer of the Blessed Sacrament</strong> - After Mass, the consecrated hosts are carried in procession to a place of reposition, where the faithful are invited to spend time in adoration.</li>
                      <li><strong>The Stripping of the Altar</strong> - The altar is cleared and crosses are removed or covered, symbolizing Jesus' abandonment by his disciples and the stripping of his garments.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      The Holy Thursday Mass ends without a concluding rite, signifying that it continues into Good Friday.

                    <p>
                      On Good Friday, the Church commemorates the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. This is a day of fasting and abstinence. The liturgy includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>The Liturgy of the Word</strong> - Including the reading of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.</li>
                      <li><strong>The Veneration of the Cross</strong> - The faithful approach a crucifix to show reverence through a kiss, touch, or bow, acknowledging the instrument of our salvation.</li>
                      <li><strong>Holy Communion</strong> - Using hosts consecrated on Holy Thursday, as there is no Mass celebrated on Good Friday.</li>
                      <li><strong>Solemn Intercessions</strong> - Special prayers offered for the needs of the Church and the world.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      The Good Friday liturgy, like Holy Thursday, ends in silence with no dismissal.

                      The Easter Vigil is the climax of the Triduum and the most important liturgy of the Church year. Traditionally celebrated after nightfall on Holy Saturday, it includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>The Service of Light</strong> - Beginning outside the church with the blessing of the new fire and the lighting of the Paschal Candle, symbolizing Christ as the Light of the World.</li>
                      <li><strong>The Liturgy of the Word</strong> - An extended series of readings that trace salvation history from Creation through the Resurrection.</li>
                      <li><strong>The Liturgy of Baptism</strong> - The blessing of baptismal water, the reception of new members into the Church through Baptism and Confirmation, and the renewal of baptismal promises by all present.</li>
                      <li><strong>The Liturgy of the Eucharist</strong> - The first celebration of the Eucharist during the Easter season, with the newly baptized receiving Communion for the first time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      The Easter Vigil concludes the Triduum, though the celebration of Easter continues with Masses on Easter Sunday and throughout the Easter Octave.
